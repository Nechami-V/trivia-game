# Technology Decision for Trivia Game

## Architecture Options

### Option 1: Dual Client Architecture (Recommended)
```
project/
├── web-client/          # React/Vue/Angular for browsers
├── mobile-app/          # React Native + Expo for mobile
└── server/              # Express.js API (existing)
```

**Pros:**
- Optimal performance per platform
- Full design flexibility
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Easier to maintain separate concerns

**Cons:**
- More development time
- Code duplication for shared logic

### Option 2: Unified Client (React Native + Expo Web)
```
project/
├── unified-client/      # React Native with web support
└── server/              # Express.js API (existing)
```

**Pros:**
- Single codebase
- Faster initial development
- Shared business logic

**Cons:**
- Web performance limitations
- Less flexibility in UI/UX
- Potential platform-specific issues

## Framework Options for Web Client

### React
- ✅ Most popular, great ecosystem
- ✅ Perfect for SPA applications
- ✅ Great developer tools
- ✅ Easy state management

### Vue.js
- ✅ Gentle learning curve
- ✅ Great performance
- ✅ Excellent documentation
- ✅ Clean syntax

### Angular
- ✅ Full framework with everything included
- ✅ Great for large applications
- ✅ Excellent TypeScript support
- ❌ Steeper learning curve

### Vanilla JS (Current)
- ✅ No build process needed
- ✅ Fast prototyping
- ✅ Full control
- ❌ Manual DOM manipulation
- ❌ No component system

## Recommendation

**For Web Client:** React with Vite
- Modern, fast development
- Great ecosystem
- Easy deployment
- Component-based architecture

**For Mobile:** React Native + Expo
- Native performance
- Cross-platform (iOS + Android)
- Great developer experience
- Easy publishing

## Next Steps
1. Choose architecture (dual vs unified)
2. Select web framework
3. Set up development environment
4. Create project structure
